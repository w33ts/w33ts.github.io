I’ve been referred to as an “ultra geek” because of my love for technology and security. Since I was a child, I’ve been tinkering with computers, bypassing my father’s security measures and learning new things. I have in depth experience with a vast array of SIEMs, SOARs, EDR/XDR Platforms and Pentesting Tools.

While my career is shifting more torwards the offensive operations and red team side of the house, my previous experience on the defensive side along with network and systems engineering gives me a fantastic background as a more experienced red team operator.

Whenever I have time, I enjoy furthering my education with a fully equipped Home Lab which includes a FortiGate Firewall and Switch, ESXi Hypervisor with Pentesting OSes and Log Management in addition to TryHackMe and Hack The Box to continuously expand my skill set. My idea of a fun evening is doing a CTF and my ideal vacation is attending a security conference. I have no life.
